# Clustering Data Project

## Overview

This repository contains a project for clustering data using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to apply unsupervised learning methods to group similar data points and analyze patterns in datasets.

## Features

- Implementation of different clustering algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering.
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling for better clustering performance.
- Evaluation of clustering results using metrics like Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index.
- Visualization of clustered data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SuperNitin123/data_cluster_tests.git
   cd your-repository
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the main clustering script:
   ```bash
   python cluster.py --algorithm kmeans --input data/sample.csv
   ```
3. Modify configurations in `config.py` to adjust clustering parameters.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Results

Clustering results, including visualizations and metrics, will be saved in the `results/` directory.
